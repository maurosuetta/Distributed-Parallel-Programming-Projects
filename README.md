# Distributed-Parallel-Programming-Projects
This repository contains multiple projects that involve distributed and parallel programming. We encompass OpenMP, MPI, CUDA, and OpenACC. It has been used a private cluster (Pirineus3) to execute the programs. You'll find explanations in the reports.

Furthermore, the code files are a new corrected version, improved even before the reports. The modifications made to the report code version are minimal and imperceptible, so you can still use the report to understand what is going on.
